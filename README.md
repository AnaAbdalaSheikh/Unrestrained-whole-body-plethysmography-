This repository contains algorithms for analysis of unrestrained whole-body plethysmography timeseries from mice. The algorhythms were optimized to analyse breathing in mouse models of Rett syndrome. They were created to work with Spike2 8.22 x64 Unicode (CED, Cambridge, Jun 28, 2021, 10:00:56 â€“ copyright Cambridge Electronic Design 1988-2019). The algorithms analyse several parameters derived of respiratory flow timeseries including inspiratory/expiratory time, peak inspiratory/expiratory flow, tidal volume, expired volume, breath frequency, minute volume, average real variability, successive variation, and apnoea count. The algorhythms also allow validation of breaths via comparison of tidal and expired volumes. For help using the script please contact ana.abdala@bristol.ac.uk.
